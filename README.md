# Run via Python
Open Command Prompt or a Terminal of some kind and run "py bot.py" for windows or "python bot.py" if py isnt a command or if you use linux.
# Build Executable from Source
You can build an executable for your system easily.  
Just run "py -m pip install pyinstaller" or "pip install pyinstaller" if it cannot find py.  
Then run "py -m pyinstaller --onefile bot.py"
## What does --onefile mean in pipinstaller?
It packs all libraries and the script into one excutable instead of many files.  
# I want to download the prebuilt version
Check releases.
